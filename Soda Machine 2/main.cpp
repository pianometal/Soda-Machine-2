//    CODING CHALLENGES
//
//    Write a program that presents the user w/ a choice of your 5 favorite beverages
//    (Coke, Water, Sprite, ... , Whatever).
//    Then allow the user to choose a beverage by entering a number 1-5.
//    Output which beverage they chose.
//
//    Soda Machine 2 is an upgraded version of my original Soda Machine
//
//    UPGRADES in 2.0
//
//    * The user now has a set amount of money and can purchase as many drinks as they want
//    provided they have sufficient funds. If they have insufficient funds, the program will exit with a code
//
//    * Drinks now cost money instead of being free.
//
//    * If the user has insufficient funds, the user is notified and the program ends.
//
//    * Program exit codes are provided at the end
